    pass

# Pseudocode
# Three constants named SLOW, MEDIUM, and FAST with the values 1, 2, and 3 to denote the fan speed.
# A constructor that creates a fan with the specified speed (default SLOW), radius (default 5), color (default blue), and on (default False).
# A private int data field named speed that specifies the speed of the fan.
# A private bool data field named on that specifies whether the fan is on (the default is False).
# A private float data field named radius that specifies the radius of the fan.
# A private string data field named color that specifies the color of the fan.
# The accessor(getters) and mutator(setters) methods for all four data fields.
